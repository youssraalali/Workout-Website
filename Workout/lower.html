    <h3>Leg Press</h3>
    <p>Difficulty: Intermediate</p>
    <img src="2022-02-05 (1).png">
    <ol class="steps-list1">
        <li>Place your legs on the platform with your feet at shoulder width.</li>
        <li>Release the weight and extend your legs fully, without locking your knees.</li>
        <li>Lower the weight until your legs are at a 90Â° angle (but DO NOT allow your butt and lower back to rise off of the pad. This will put your lower back in a rounded position, which is very dangerous.)</li>
        <li>Raise the weight back to starting position.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Forward Lunge</h3>
    <p>Difficulty: Beginner</p>

    <ol class="steps-list2">
        <li>Stand straight with your feet slightly apart and hold a kettlebell in one hand.</li>
        <li>Bring the same leg as the arm holding the kettlebell in front of you, squat down until your thigh is parallel to the ground, keeping your back straight.</li>
        <li>Return to the starting position and repeat.</li>
    </ol>
